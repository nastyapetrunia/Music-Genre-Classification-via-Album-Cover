## Data Collection
As this project was a final project at Data Science Summer Camp, it had some requirements. 

1. Music genres: rap, folk, hard rock, disco, and electronic music.
2. Years: 2000-2022

So the data was collected from [AllMusic Advanced Search](https://www.allmusic.com/advanced-search) using Selenium.
